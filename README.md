# Bruteforcer
We need to create Password.txt file by thinking some default passwords otherwise download from google or get it from github.
After running code it will ask
URL: 192.168.1.1/dvwa/login.php (default vartual machine ) (The url to which we want to bruteforce the password enter that URL)
username : admin (default,  that you should know.)
password : Admin (default) (It will match from password.txt file)
Lastly it will tell whether login is successful or failed.
Thank you
